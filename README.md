# DAMPP (XAMPP on Docker)

Or how to run Apache+PHP, MySQL, PHPMyAdmin and Tomcat with a single `docker-compose up`.

## Features

* Run PHP and Java web apps with MySQL support
* Manage MySQL databases with ease thanks to PHPMyAdmin
* Isolated Docker containers for each server
* Perl free! (_who's using it nowadays [on web projects] ?_)
* ...anything else to add?

## Steps

### Prerequisites

* Docker 1.24+
* Docker Compose 1.9.0+
* OS of your choice (tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x64)

```
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/cgrs/dampp.git
$ cd dampp
$ docker-compose up [-d]
```

Put all your PHP work on `www/`. Tomcat goes on `webapps/`.

_I've added a sample files, just to test the setup and to keep
the folder structure._

## Notes

Feel free to modify anything to your own likings.

I'd accept merge requests as long as they're bugfixes. I'll leave feature requests apart just because this is a personal project.
